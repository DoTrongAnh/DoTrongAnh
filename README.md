- 👋 Hi, I’m @DoTrongAnh
  - Recent graduate in Computer Engineering (Master), featuring Sofware Development, Data Analysis, Database fundamentals and System Reliability Testing, with corresponding language and techologies.
  - Pursuing a career in the field in Canada (being half the globe away makes remote working not at all ideal, and it limits a lot of job opportunities sadly.)
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
  - Writing code in general, have the most fun with learning by code experimentation.
  - Video games (I'm starting to think maybe I'm too attached to my PC).
  - Reading, although I'm highly selective on reading materials, and anything other than literature generally bores me (unless it's necessary that I read it).
  - Doing scientific research, oddly enough. It's where I started as graduate, and I find any assignments that focus highly on doing research and reporting findings to be extremely engaging and enjoyable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - French, first of all. I have a love-hate relationship with this language, but I won't give up on it.
  - From XML basics to Scala fundamentals, as I approach functional programming paradigm, I'll have a lot to learn off-program.
  - Recently I've also been learning Machine Learning fundamentals. Hopefullly I can kickstart my career into the Data Science space.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
  - Developing new software techologies
  - Conducting experiments with deep learning algorithms
- 📫 How to reach me ...
  - My LinkedIn profile. The more connections the better.
  - My Facebook page, though I rarely use FB. But you can contact me for anything not work-related.
  - Interested in video games? Play Genshin Impact with me (DM me at FB and give me your UID, so I can add and join you).
- Taking note of recruiters:
  - Clairvoyant
  - Pitstop
  - TribalScale
  - Wagepoint
  - QEOSH
  - Thrillworks
  - Havas CX
